            <p>
                The Autonomous Water Surface Cleaning Robot is a 2.5m x 1.5m x 0.7m modular device designed to clean water bodies efficiently.
                Featuring a stable catamaran-shaped hull, the robot is equipped with a conveyor belt for trash collection and integrates IoT and advanced algorithms for smart navigation, cleaning, and environmental monitoring.
                It can collect up to 25kg of waste and move at a speed of 1.5m/s using propellers. The robot's eco-friendly design supports sustainability by recycling collected waste into fuel or new products.
                Its modular, reconfigurable components ensure easy maintenance and upgrades, making it a versatile solution for water conservation.
                It leverages smart technology, IoT integration, and AI-based algorithms to efficiently clean surfaces.
                Our mission is to create robots that can autonomously perform cleaning tasks, minimizing human intervention.
